# Quizzy buzz

A simple quiz app with a drinking game spin.

Disclaimer... not advocating excessive drinking nor promoting alcohol, just a silly idea to utilize the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php/) when exploring react and react hooks.

## Development

This project uses [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as its bundler.

### `npm run dev`

Starts development server on http://localhost:1234 with hot reloading and uses `dev/` as its working directory.

### `npm run build`

Builds app into `dist/` for production use.
